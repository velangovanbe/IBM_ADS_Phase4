# Customer-Segmentation-using-K-means-clustering
In todayâ€™s competitive world, it is crucial to understand customer behavior and categorize customers based on their demography and buying behavior. This is a critical aspect of customer segmentation that allows marketers to better tailor their marketing efforts to various audience subsets in terms of promotional, marketing and product development strategies. In this project, execute and apply the scientific approach using k-means clustering algorithm and supermarket mall dataset are analyzed, the dataset values and parameters provide an organized understanding of the customer buying patterns and behavior base on this study applied model and deploys dataset segmentation principles using K-Means clustering algorithms. I used python programming language for implementing clustering algorithms. A variety of dataset clusters are validated based on the calculation of Elbow method and Silhouette Coefficient. In result, identify target customer segment by divide into groups according to common characteristics and also visualize the four features of customers based on dataset so that the sense can be given to marketing team and plan the strategy accordingly.
